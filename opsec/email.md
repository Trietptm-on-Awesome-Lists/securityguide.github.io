Never click a link to change your password

In general, it is best practice to never click any links in emails.

This is especially important when changing passwords.

 ****
 Always type manually into your browser the site needed for changing your password. Never click on a link in order to change your password, even if the link appears to be something simple like "accounts.google.com"

From time to time, various services might mail you to notify you that a new device has authenticate, or warn you there might be a password compromise.

This is a very common approach to phishing attacks. Often, a phishing attack will tell you (falsely) that you have fallen victim to a phishing attack.

The most famous phishing attack of all, the one against the DNC during the 2016 election, was exactly this sort of false alert that the user needs to change their password.
